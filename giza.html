            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the
              necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most
              famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the
              Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE), recent excavations on the plateau
              have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
              quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with
              amazing precision and skill but, once it became associated with
              the great kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the
              attention of less prominent officials of lower rank. These
              officials had enough money and prestige to buy their way into
              burial plots at Giza but had no regard for the symmetry of the
              original schematics and had their tombs dug wherever they found
              available space. This resulted in a number of grave complexes
              throughout Giza which would not have been authorized by the kings
              who built the famous pyramids which, throughout history, have
              drawn visitors from around the world.
