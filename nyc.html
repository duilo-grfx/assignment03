            <h2>About New York City</h2>
            <p>
              New York City consists of five boroughs, which are five separate
              counties. Each borough has a unique culture and could be a large
              city in its own right. Within each borough individual
              neighborhoods, some several square miles in size, and others only
              a few blocks in size, have personalities lauded in music and film.
              Where you live, work, and play in New York says something to New
              Yorkers about who you are. The five New York boroughs are: New
