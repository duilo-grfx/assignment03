        <h2>About Toronto</h2>
        <div class="page">
          <p class="page-item">
            Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario.
            With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most
            populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North
            America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban
            agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the
            western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
            proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an
            international center of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is
            recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities
            in the world.
          </p>

          <p class="page-item">
            People have traveled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located
            on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines,
            and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly
            disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area
            to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in
            1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During
            the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and
            suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed and
            incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as
            the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian
            Confederation. The city proper has since expanded past its original
            borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area
            of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi)

          <h2>Economy</h2>
          <p>
            The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and
            historical role as an important destination for immigrants to
            Canada. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible
            minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are
            represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of
            Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160
            languages are spoken in the city.

          <h2>Festivities</h2>
          <p>
            Toronto is a prominent center for music, theatre, motion picture
            production, and television production, and is home to the
            headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media
            outlets. Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous
            museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment
            districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract
            over 43 million tourists each year. Toronto is known for its many
            skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest
            free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, the CN Tower.

            The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of
            Canada's five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large
            Canadian and multinational corporations. Its economy is highly
            diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial
            services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace,
            environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.
