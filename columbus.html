        <h2>About Columbus</h2>

        <div class="page">
          <p class="page-item">
            Columbus is the state capital and the most populous city in the U.S.
            state of Ohio. With a population estimated at 898,553 in 2019, it is
            the 14th-most populous city in the U.S., the second-most populous
            city in the Midwest after Chicago, and the third-most populous state
            capital. Columbus is the county seat of Franklin County; it also
            extends into Delaware and Fairfield counties. It is the core city of
            the Columbus, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses
            ten counties. With a 2019 estimated population of 2,122,271, it is
            the largest metropolitan area entirely in Ohio.

          <p class="page-item">
            Columbus originated as numerous Native American settlements on the
            banks of the Scioto River. Franklinton, now a city neighborhood, was
            the first white settlement, laid out in 1797. The city was founded
            in 1812, at the confluence of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and
            laid out to become the state capital. The city was named for Italian
            explorer Christopher Columbus. The city assumed the function of
            state capital in 1816 and county seat in 1824. Amid steady years of
            growth and industrialization, the city has experienced numerous
            floods and recessions. Beginning in the 1950s, Columbus began to
            experience significant growth; it became the largest city in Ohio in
            land and population by the early 1990s. The 1990s and 2000s saw
            redevelopment in numerous city neighborhoods, including downtown.
